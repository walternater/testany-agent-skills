## Writing Guidance

### System Overview Chapter

1. **Function Overview**: A paragraph that clearly explains what this function does
2. **Caller**: Who will use this function and under what circumstances it will be used?
3. **Capability Overview**: Use a simple flow chart to illustrate input and output

### Functional Requirements chapter

Each functional module contains:

1. **Functional Description**: Business purpose and value
2. **Processing process**: business process, not technical implementation
3. **Business Rules**: Business logic constraints
4. **Input and Output**: What is needed, what is produced

### Interface capability chapter

**Note**: PRD only describes the interface "capabilities" and does not design specific APIs.

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
### Create order ability

| Properties | Description |
|------|------|
| Capability description | Create order based on shopping cart |
| Caller | Front-end shopping cart page |
| Authentication requirements | User login required |

#### Enter requirements
- Shopping cart product list
- Shipping address
- Payment method

#### Output requirements
- On success: Return order number
- On failure: Return the reason for failure
```

**Wrong writing (crossing the boundary to HLD)**:

    ### POST /api/v1/orders

| Properties | Values ​​|
    |------|-----|
| Method | POST |
| path | /api/v1/orders |

#### Request body
    {
      "cart_id": "string",
      "address_id": "string"
    }

### Data Concept Chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Entity | Description | Key Attributes |
|------|------|----------|
| Order | User's purchase record | Order number, amount, status, order time |
| Line item | Products in the order | Product name, quantity, unit price |
```

**Wrong writing (crossing the boundary to HLD)**:
```markdown
| Fields | Types | Constraints |
|------|------|------|
| id | UUID | PRIMARY KEY |
| created_at | TIMESTAMP | NOT NULL |
```

### Business rules form

| Rule number | Rule description | Trigger conditions |
|----------|----------|----------|
| BR-001 | Users can only create 10 projects per day | Check when creating a project |
| BR-002 | Orders that are not paid for more than 30 minutes will be automatically canceled | Regular check |

### Example of acceptance criteria

```markdown
### AC-001: Create Order
- [ ] You can create an order when there are items in the shopping cart
- [ ] Prompt the user when inventory is low and refuse to create
- [ ] Return the order number after successful creation
- [ ] The order status is initially "pending payment"

### AC-002: Order timeout cancellation
- [ ] Orders not paid for 30 minutes will be automatically canceled
- [ ] Release inventory on cancellation
- [ ] Send cancellation notification (if notification channel is configured)
```
