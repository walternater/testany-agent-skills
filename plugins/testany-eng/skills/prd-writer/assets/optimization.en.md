## 2. Background and goals

### 2.1 Optimize background

[Describe why optimization is needed and what are the triggers]

- Business growth leads to performance bottlenecks
- Issues discovered by security audits
- User feedback
- Monitor alarms
- other reasons

### 2.2 Optimization goals

| Indicator | Current value (baseline) | Target value | Data source | Improvement |
|------|----------------|--------|----------|----------|
| [Indicator 1] | [Current value] | [Target value] | Already monitored/need to add | [Percent] |
| [Indicator 2] | [Current value] | [Target value] | Already monitored/need to add | [Percent] |

### 2.3 Constraints

- Does not change user experience
- [Other constraints]

### 2.4 Relevant capability identification (mandatory)

| Existing capabilities | Capability scope | Matching degree with current needs | Capability gaps | Suggested directions | Source |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------|---------|------|
| [Capability name] | [Scope covered by this capability] | Complete match/Partial match/No match | [Gap description, fill in "None" if there is no gap] | Recommended reuse/Recommended reference/Need to create new | [Document/code path] |

> **Description**:
> - This table is a mandatory output to identify existing capabilities that can assist optimization (such as existing caching solutions, monitoring tools, security components, etc.)
> - **"Source" column is required**: You must indicate which document or code the capability was identified from, and no baseless guessing is allowed.
> - "Recommended directions" are only PRD suggestions, and the final reuse decision falls within the scope of HLD
> - If it is confirmed that there is no relevant ability, fill in "After investigation, there is no relevant ability" and explain the **scope of investigation** (which paths/keywords were searched)

## Writing Guidance

### Core points of optimizing PRD

1. **Data-driven**: Use data to explain problems and goals
2. **Baseline comparison**: Clear comparison before and after optimization
3. **Clear goals**: clear quantitative goals
4. **Verification Complete**: Detailed verification requirements
5. **Grayscale verification**: Verify the optimization effect in stages

### Problem Analysis Chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Problem number | Problem description | Frequency of occurrence | Impact |
|----------|----------|----------|------|
| P-001 | The list page loads slowly | 100% during peak periods | Users wait for a long time and the conversion rate drops |
| P-002 | Search timeout | About 5% of requests per day | Poor user experience |
```

**Wrong way of writing (too technical)**:
```markdown
| Issue number | Issue description |
|----------|----------|
| P-001 | MySQL query does not use index, you need to add created_at index |
```

### Optimization target chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Metrics | Current Baseline | Target Value | Priority |
|------|----------|--------|--------|
| List page loading time P99 | 3s | ≤ 1s | P0 |
| Search success rate | 95% | ≥ 99.5% | P0 |
```

**Wrong writing (including technical solutions)**:
```markdown
| Optimization items | Plans |
|--------|------|
| Add cache | Use Redis to cache hotspot data, TTL 5 minutes |
| Add index | Add (user_id, created_at) composite index to the orders table |
```

### Grayscale verification form example

```markdown
| Stage | Traffic proportion | Duration | Observation indicators | Rollback conditions |
|------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| Phase 1 | 1% | 1 hour | Error rate, latency | Error rate > 1% |
| Phase 2 | 10% | 4 hours | Error rate, latency | Error rate > 0.5% |
| Phase 3 | 50% | 1 day | Error rate, latency, throughput | Error rate > 0.1% |
| Full amount | 100% | - | All indicators | - |
```

### Example of acceptance criteria

```markdown
### AC-001: Performance Goals Achieved
- [ ] List page P99 delay ≤ 1s
- [ ] Search success rate ≥ 99.5%
- [ ] Home page loading time ≤ 2s

### AC-002: Functionality not affected
- [ ] All functions work properly
- [ ] All automated tests passed
- [ ] User unaware

### AC-003: Improved monitoring
- [ ] New indicators are collected normally.
- [ ] Alarm rules are configured correctly
- [ ] You can see the optimization effect on the market
