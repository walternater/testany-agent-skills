## 2. Background and goals

### 2.1 Reconstruction background

[Describe why refactoring is needed]

### 2.2 Refactoring goals

[Describe the desired state after refactoring]

1. **Goal 1**: [Specific description]
2. **Goal 2**: [Specific description]

### 2.3 Success Indicators

| Indicator | Current value | Target value | Data source | Measurement method |
|------|--------|--------|----------|----------|
| [Indicator] | [Current] | [Target] | Already monitored/need to add | [Measurement method] |

### 2.4 What not to do

Clearly state that this refactoring does not include functional changes:

- Does not change the behavior of [Feature A]
- Does not change user experience
- Do not change the external interface contract

### 2.5 Relevant capability identification (mandatory)

| Existing capabilities | Capability scope | Matching degree with current needs | Capability gaps | Suggested directions | Source |
|----------|---------|--------------|---------|---------|------|
| [Capability name] | [Scope covered by this capability] | Complete match/Partial match/No match | [Gap description, fill in "None" if there is no gap] | Recommended reuse/Recommended reference/Need to create new | [Document/code path] |

> **Description**:
> - This table is a mandatory output, identifying existing capabilities that can assist refactoring (such as existing design patterns, tool libraries, test frameworks, etc.)
> - **"Source" column is required**: You must indicate which document or code the capability was identified from, and no baseless guessing is allowed.
> - "Recommended directions" are only PRD suggestions, and the final reuse decision falls within the scope of HLD
> - If it is confirmed that there is no relevant ability, fill in "After investigation, there is no relevant ability" and explain the **scope of investigation** (which paths/keywords were searched)

## Writing Guidance

### Reconstructing the core points of PRD

1. **Clear "what not to do"**: Refactoring should not change external behavior and should be clearly stated
2. **Problem-driven**: Explain clearly the problems of the current situation and what should be solved by refactoring
3. **Goal state**: Describes the desired state rather than specific technical solutions
4. **Compatibility**: Clarify compatibility requirements
5. **Verification Requirements**: How to verify successful refactoring

### Current Situation Analysis Chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Issue Number | Issue Description | Impact | Severity |
|----------|----------|------|----------|
| P-001 | Module responsibilities are not clear, modifying one place affects many places | Development efficiency is low, bug rate is high | High |
| P-002 | Severe code duplication | High maintenance costs | Medium |
```

**Wrong way of writing (too technical)**:
```markdown
| Issue number | Issue description |
|----------|----------|
| P-001 | UserService has 2000 lines of code and needs to be split into UserQueryService and UserCommandService |
```

### Reconstruct the target state chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Dimensions | Current status | Target status |
|------|----------|----------|
| Module responsibilities | Confused responsibilities | Single responsibilities and clear boundaries |
| Code duplication | Repeated logic in many places | Logic reuse, no duplication |
| Testability | Difficult to unit test | Independently testable |
```

**Wrong writing (crossing the boundary to HLD)**:
```markdown
| Changes | Current | Target |
|--------|------|------|
| UserService.ts | Single file 2000 lines | Split into 3 files |
| Database queries | Direct SQL | Using Repository mode |
```

### Example of acceptance criteria

```markdown
### AC-001: Function unchanged
- [ ] The user login process is normal
- [ ] The order creation process is normal
- [ ] All API return formats remain unchanged
- [ ] All automated tests passed

### AC-002: No performance regression
- [ ] Login interface P99 delay is no higher than before reconstruction
- [ ] Order query QPS is not lower than before reconstruction

### AC-003: Problem Solving
- [ ] Modifying the user module no longer affects the order module
- [ ] Improve the development efficiency of new functions (subjective evaluation)
```
