## Writing Guidance

### Solution Analysis Chapter

When there are multiple candidates:
1. List the evaluation dimensions (function, price, documentation, community, compliance, etc.)
2. Score or describe each solution
3. Give program suggestions and reasons (note: the final selection decision rests with HLD)

If there is a clear preferred plan, the reasons for the recommendation still need to be stated.

### Integration requirements chapter

**Note**: PRD describes "what capabilities are required" and does not design "how to call them".

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Our functions | Third-party capabilities | Description |
|----------|------------|------|
| Send SMS verification code | Send SMS | Used for user registration and login |
| Query sending status | Status query | Used to confirm delivery |
```

**Wrong writing (crossing the boundary to HLD)**:
```markdown
| Our functions | Third-party interface | Calling method |
|----------|------------|----------|
| Send SMS | POST /sms/send | Synchronous call, timeout 3s |
```

### Exception handling requirements chapter

**Correct writing**:
```markdown
| Scenario | Downgrade Plan | User Tips |
|------|----------|----------|
| The payment service is unavailable | Display a maintenance prompt and guide you to try again later | "The payment service is temporarily busy, please try again later" |
| AI service timed out | Returning default results | "AI responded slowly and has returned default results for you" |
```

**Wrong writing (crossing the boundary to HLD)**:
```markdown
Retry strategy: Maximum retries 3 times, exponential backoff, initial interval 1s
Fuse configuration: Error rate > 50% triggers fuse, fuse duration is 30s
```

### Example of acceptance criteria

```markdown
### AC-001: SMS sending
- [ ] Enter the correct mobile phone number and the verification code is sent successfully
- [ ] Verification code is valid for 5 minutes
- [ ] The same mobile phone number can only be sent once in 1 minute.

### AC-002: Exception handling
- [ ] Display friendly prompts when SMS service is unavailable
- [ ] Users can try again when sending fails
- [ ] Error log is recorded correctly
```
