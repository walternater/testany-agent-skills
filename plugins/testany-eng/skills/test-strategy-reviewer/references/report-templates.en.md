## Gate 1: Baseline and Range
- {Conclusion and Evidence}

## Gate 2: Risk coverage and independent test layering
- {Conclusion and Evidence}

## Gate 3: Environment/Data/Dependencies
- {Conclusion and Evidence}

## Gate 4: Access Control and Automation
- {Conclusion and Evidence}

## Question list

### P0
- {Question} (Evidence: {Location})

### P1
- {Question} (Evidence: {Location})
- {Missing staged execution rules / Mistaking subsequent stage access control as current stage failure / Substituting environment for stage definition} (evidence: {location})

### P2
- {Question} (Evidence: {Location})

## Release conclusion

- **Passed**: can be used as a baseline for `test-spec-writer`
or
- **Fail**: Review after repair

## Approval Certificate Template

```markdown
#✅ Test Strategy is certified

- **Strategy Documentation**: {path}
- **Baseline**: PRD/API/HLD/Guardrails
- **Review Round**: Round {N}
- **Conclusion**: Passed
- **Script verification**: `trace-lint` passed, `trace-build-rtm` had no build error
- **Phase Description**: The boundary between the exit of the current stage and the environmental-level access control in subsequent stages has been clarified
- **Note**: This test strategy can be used as the baseline for detailed test specifications and test case packages
