## Basic Information

- **PRD Baseline**: {path} v{version}
- **API Contract Baseline**: {path} v{version}
- **HLD Baseline**: {path} v{version}
- **LLD Baseline**: {path} v{version}
- **Test Strategy**: {path} v{version}
- **Guardrails**: {path} / N/A
- **Status**: Draft/Reviewed/Approved

## scope

### In-scope
- {content}

### Out-of-scope
- {content}

### API Contract verification scope
- **Responsibility Boundary**: QA is responsible for approving the black box verification and regression of the API Contract; if development/SDET provides provider-side contract suite, it is only used as supplementary evidence
- **Verification Point List**: {interface group/operation/verification point}
- **Coverage dimensions**: {path/method/parameters/headers/request fields/response fields/status codes/error semantics/permissions/idempotent/compatible semantics}

### Develop built-in validation preconditions
- **Unit Test**: {Requirement/Status}
- **Code-level Integration Test**: {Requirement/Status}
- **Optional Supplementary Evidence**: provider-side contract suite / calling script: {requirements/status}
- **Note**: Approval of the black box verification of the API Contract belongs to the In-scope of this test package and cannot be excluded only as an upstream precondition

## Traceability matrix

| Source Type | Source ID/Location | Test Item | Status | Notes |
|----------|----------------|--------|------|------|
| PRD / API / HLD / LLD / Risk | {ID or Location} | {Case ID} | Covered / Partially Covered / Not Covered | {Description} |

## Coverage Summary

| Metrics | Numerator definition | Denominator definition | Coverage | Uncovered items |
|------|----------|----------|--------|----------|
| Requirement Coverage | Number of in-scope requirements that have been traced by at least 1 test item | Total number of in-scope requirements | {x/y = z%} | {ID List / None} |
| API Contract coverage | Number of in-scope API Contract verification points that have been covered by at least 1 test item | Total number of in-scope API Contract verification points | {x/y = z%} | {Verification point list / none} |
| risk coverage | number of in-scope risks that have been covered by at least 1 test item | total number of in-scope risks | {x/y = z%} | {ID list / none} |
| High risk coverage | Number of high risk items covered | Total number of high risk items | {x/y = z%} | {ID list / none} |
| Must-not-regress coverage | Number of must-not-regress items that have been covered by the regression package | Total number of must-not-regress items | {x/y = z%} | {ID list / none} |
| External behavior coverage | Number of in-scope external observable behaviors that have been covered by the test item | Total number of in-scope external observable behaviors | {x/y = z%} | {ID list / none} |
| Scene coverage rate | Number of covered scenes | Total number of identified scenes | {x/y = z%} | {Scene list / None} |
| Must-test NFR coverage | Number of must-test NFR items for the designed verification scheme | Total number of must-test NFR items | {x/y = z%} | {NFR list / none} |

### Description of statistical caliber

- The above is **test design coverage**, not code coverage, nor execution coverage
- The denominator contains only in-scope terms
- The following do not enter the denominator:
  - Out-of-scope
- Exemptions approved
  - unit / code-level integration
- Items that are clearly the responsibility of other independent test packages and have been referenced
- It is not allowed to give only one comprehensive total coverage, it must be displayed item by item
